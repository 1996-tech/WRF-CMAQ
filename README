WRF-CMAQ
CMAQ 5.5
Installtion: Full process is described by USEPA (link- https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/blob/main/DOCS/Users_Guide/CMAQ_UG_ch05_running_a_simulation.md). However, the process can vary in different Operating system of HPCs. I have modified the installation process for intel 25.0 compiler. The major modifications are included in config_cmaq.csh.save. The   
rest of the process will remain same. 
Environmental Setup/tools: intel 25.0
                     openmpi 4.* upper
Run scripts: (CRACMM) version 1 including updated formaldehyde chemistry impacting ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation.

Fire Inventory: WRF-Fire
Inline Biogenic Emission: 
BEIS (Biogenic Emissions Inventory System) will enable inline biogenic processing in CMAQ. This is typically done during CMAQ preprocessing and run-time using inputs from WRF meteorology and land use.
Steps: 
-Step 1: Prepare Meteorology with WRF/MCIP
WRF outputs processed by MCIP, which prepares:
3D meteorology (METCRO3D)
2D surface fields (METCRO2D)
Land cover info (GRIDCRO2D, LUFRAC, etc.)
Ensure  MCIP domain is consistent with CMAQ grid.

-Step 2: Enable Inline Biogenic Emissions in CMAQ
In your run_cctm.csh script, set these environment variables:
********
csh
setenv BIOGEMIS  Y
setenv MEGAN_BIOGEMIS Y   # Optional: for MEGAN inline (if enabled)
setenv GRIDDESC  ${GRIDDESC_FILE}
setenv GRID_NAME ${GRID_NAME}
setenv CTM_BIOGEMIS 1     # 1 = BEIS inline; 2 = MEGAN inline
********
For CMAQ v5.5, BEIS is the default inline mechanism. MEGAN is optional and requires extra data.
-Step 3: Set Emission Control Flags in CMAQ
In your run_cctm.csh file:
********
setenv CTM_BIOGEMIS 1
0 = no biogenic emissions
1 = BEIS (default, uses MCIP land use + meteorology)
2 = MEGAN (requires additional inputs)
********
-Step 4: Ensure Required Input Files Exist
CMAQ will read the following MCIP outputs for inline biogenics:
File	Description
GRIDCRO2D	Land-use fractions
METCRO2D	Surface meteorology (temperature, PAR, etc.)
METCRO3D	3D meteorology for dispersion
LWMASK	Land-water mask
LUFRAC_*.nc	Land use fractions by category (if using MEGAN)
Check if these exist in your input folder ($METDIR). You can list with:
********
bash
ls $METDIR/GRIDCRO2D*
ls $METDIR/METCRO2D*
********
-Step 5: Set Species Mapping
No need to prepare external .emis files for biogenic VOCs like:
********
ISOP (isoprene)
TERP (terpenes)
MEOH, FORM, etc.
********
CMAQ calculates these inline from land use and met.
-Step 6: Run WRF-CMAQ
After setting up run_cctm.csh:
********
bash
sbatch run_cctm_WRFCMAQ.csh
********
Check CCTM_LOG output. You should see lines like:
********
scss
********
Inline Biogenic Emissions Activated: BEIS
Also, you’ll see biogenic species (ISOP, TERP) being emitted and processed.

Notes
Item	Notes
Emission inventory	No separate .emis file needed for biogenics
Plume rise	Not needed; biogenic sources are low-level
Photolysis	Inline biogenics depend on PAR, so verify your photolysis fields (J-values) are correct
Output	You’ll see biogenic contributions in output species like O3, PAN, SOA
